### Getting Started
Detailed instructions can be found on the [Using LiteMigrator](https://github.com/xenoinc/SQLiteMigrator/wiki/Using-LiteMigrator) wiki page.

1. Add **LiteMigrator** project to your solution
2. Create a folder in your solution to hold the scripts
3. Add SQL files as **Embedded Resources**
  * You must use the naming convention, "_YYYYMMDDhhmm-FileName.sql_"
4. Wire-up the controller

```cs
public async Task InstallMigrationsAsync()
{
  // Your EXE/DLL with the scripts
  var resourceAssm = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
  var dbPath = @"C:\TEMP\MyDatabase.db3";
  var migsNamespace = "MyProjNamespace.Scripts";

  var liteMig = new LiteMigration(dbPath, resourceAssm, migsNamespace);
  bool = success = await liteMig.MigrateUpAsync();
}
```
