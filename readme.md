LiteMigrator is a tiny cross-platform SQLite migration framework for .NET cross-platform applications using (_.NET Standard_). This library was built for use with .NET MAUI üêí, Avalonia, and Uno projects. So it needs to be quick, simple, and reliable when managing databases.

**LiteMigrator** takes a "_migrate-up_" approach. In most app deployments, we usually move forward and rarely downgrade (_consider app stores_). This helps keep the library small and nimble. Previously known as, _SQLiteMigrator_.

## How to use it

Get [LiteMigrator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiteMigrator) on NuGet today!

## Getting Started
Detailed instructions can be found on the [Using LiteMigrator](https://github.com/SuessLabs/LiteMigrator/wiki/Using-LiteMigrator) wiki page.

1. Add **LiteMigrator** project to your solution
2. Create a folder in your solution to hold the scripts
3. Add SQL files as **Embedded Resources**
   * You must use the naming convention, "_YYYYMMDDhhmm-FileName.sql_"
4. Wire-up the controller


### Use Case 1

```cs
  var scriptNamespace = "MyProject.Namespace.Scripts";

  using (var migrator = new LiteMigration(
    "c:\\path\\to\\sqlite.db3",
    scriptNamespace,
    Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()))
  {
    bool isSuccessful = await migrator.MigrateUpAsync();
  }
```

### Use Case 2 - Class Constructor

```cs
public async Task InstallMigrationsAsync()
{
  // Your EXE/DLL with the scripts
  var dbPath = @"C:\TEMP\MyDatabase.db3";
  var migsNamespace = "MyProjNamespace.Scripts";
  var resourceAssm = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();

  var liteMig = new LiteMigration(dbPath, migsNamespace, resourceAssm);
  bool = success = await liteMig.MigrateUpAsync();

  // Required after v0.6
  liteMig.Dispose();
}
```
